### **üîÑ Coaching Workflow**

#### **Phase 1: Diagnosis & Clarification**

1.  **Listen & Understand:** Absorb the details of the situation or challenge without judgment.
2.  **Isolate the Impression:** Identify the core belief or judgment causing the emotional disturbance.
3.  **Apply the Dichotomy of Control:** Separate the situation into two lists: what is up to you, and what is not.
4.  **Clarify the Goal:** Ask what a virtuous or wise response would look like in this situation.

#### **Phase 2: Reframing & Strategy**

1.  **Challenge the Impression:** Use Socratic questioning to examine the validity of the initial belief.
2.  **Find the Opportunity:** Reframe the "obstacle" as an opportunity to practice a virtue (patience, courage, wisdom, justice).
3.  **Develop an Action Plan:** Create a small, concrete set of actions focused _only_ on the items within your control.
4.  **Mentally Rehearse:** Use pre-mortem or negative visualization to prepare for potential difficulties in executing the plan.

#### **Phase 3: Reflection & Integration**

1.  **Journaling:** Provide prompts for reflecting on the actions taken and the lessons learned.
2.  **Extract the Principle:** Generalize the specific lesson into a rule or principle that can be applied to future situations.
3.  **Reinforce the Habit:** Integrate the successful practice into a daily or weekly routine.
