### **Handbook 5: The Signal-Hunter's Handbook for Data Analysis**

**Introduction: Separating Signal from Noise**

This handbook is a specialized guide for using AI as an analytical partner. Its purpose is to help you move beyond simple data queries to proactively find patterns, test hypotheses, and generate actionable insights. While the original prompts were developed in a financial trading context, the principles here are designed to be adapted to any data-driven field where you need to separate a true "signal" from the surrounding "noise."

---

#### **Chapter 1: The Core Principles of Analytical Prompting**

1. **Frame with Role and Outcome**: Always begin your prompt by assigning the AI an expert role ("Act as a financial analyst," "Act as a market strategist"). This immediately focuses its analytical lens and improves the quality of the insights.  
2. **Use Iterative Narrowing**: Start with a broad, exploratory question. Use the AI's initial response to progressively refine your criteria, zeroing in on the specific signal you are investigating.  
3. **Request Structured Output**: Don't accept a wall of text. Ask for the analysis in a specific, usable format like a checklist, a timeline-style breakdown, or a comparison table. This makes the information easier to digest and act upon.  
4. **Move from Queries to Systems**: The ultimate goal is to stop asking about one-off events and start building reusable systems. Use the AI to help you create checklists and frameworks that you can deploy anytime a similar event occurs.

---

#### **Chapter 2: The Signal Detection Library**

Use these prompts to find patterns and correlations in data.

* **Template 1: The Event-Reaction Analysis**

  * **Purpose**: To understand how a system typically responds to a specific, recurring type of event.  
  * **Exemplar Prompt**: Act as a financial analyst. When a major natural disaster (like a hurricane or wildfire) makes landfall in North America, how do stocks in the home improvement sector (e.g., Home Depot, Lowe’s) typically respond in the first 48 hours? Provide a timeline-style breakdown of the price movement and include real-world examples.  
* **Template 2: The Reusable Pattern-Finder**

  * **Purpose**: To create a generic checklist for identifying when an event is likely to create an actionable signal.  
  * **Exemplar Prompt**: \`Create a reusable checklist for detecting when a weather or disaster event is likely to trigger a short-term rally in a specific sector’s stocks. The checklist should focus on key variables to monitor, including:  
    * Pre-event media attention levels.  
    * Supply-chain and demand factors.  
    * Institutional investor behavior.  
    * Public sentiment momentum.\`

---

#### **Chapter 3: Strategy Simulation & Back-Testing**

Once you've identified a potential signal, these prompts help you test its viability as a strategy.

* **Template 1: The Strategy Simulator**

  * **Purpose**: To back-test a potential strategy using historical data to gauge its potential effectiveness.

  * Exemplar Prompt:  
    \`Act as a quantitative analyst. Simulate a trading strategy where I go long on Home Depot (HD) and Lowe’s (LOW) stock 48 hours before a Category 3+ hurricane is projected to make landfall in the US.

     Based on the last 10 such hurricanes, please provide:

    * The probability of success (percentage of times the stocks were up 7 days later).  
    * The average and median return of the strategy.  
    * The best-case and worst-case outcome from a single event.\`  
* **Template 2: The Automation Design Brief**

  * **Purpose**: To design a no-code automation that can monitor for your signal in real-time.  
  * **Exemplar Prompt**: \`Design a no-code automation pipeline that alerts me when a major storm is forecasted in a densely populated area of North America and cross-references that with a "buy" signal for home improvement stocks. The design brief should include:  
    * The weather API or data source to use.  
    * The stock API to use.  
    * The specific logic for the trade signal (e.g., "Storm Category \> 2 AND Media Mentions \> 1000/hr").  
    * The alert method (e.g., email, SMS).\`

---

#### **Chapter 4: Risk Assessment & Bias Checking**

This is the most critical step. Use these prompts to find the flaws in your own analysis before you act on it.

* **Template 1: The Bias Check**

  * **Purpose**: To have the AI identify the common psychological and data-related biases that could be skewing your analysis.  
  * **Exemplar Prompt**: Act as a behavioral finance expert. What are the most common psychological biases that affect investors trying to trade stocks based on natural disaster events? Please describe the risks of overconfidence, recency bias, and survivorship bias in the context of using past storms to inform future trades.  
* **Template 2: The Pre-Mortem Analysis**

  * **Purpose**: To uncover hidden risks by imagining the strategy has already failed.  
  * **Exemplar Prompt**: We have decided to execute the hurricane-based trading strategy. Imagine it is six months from now and the strategy has failed catastrophically, losing 50% of its capital. Working backward from that outcome, describe the three most likely reasons or events that would have caused this failure.

### **Handbook 2: The Creative Strategist's Handbook for Project Development**
