# **üìñ Game Designer's Handbook**

_A Comprehensive Guide to Designing, Prototyping, and Refining Games_

## **üéØ Introduction: From a Haphazard Idea to a Playable Prototype**

This handbook is a practical toolkit for turning a creative spark into a structured, playable game. By partnering with an AI, you can build a systematic process for yourself, using it to handle structuring, content generation, and polishing. This guide provides a collection of optimized, copy-and-paste prompts designed to help you generate mechanics, create narrative content, and analyze the balance of your game.

## **üöÄ Phase 1: Finding the Core and Building the Roadmap**

### **1.1 The Roadmap Builder**

- **Purpose:** To create a step-by-step project plan from a defined goal, overcoming creative paralysis.
- **Exemplar Prompt:**  
  ROLE: You are a 'Project Manager' and 'Creative Coach.'

  TASK: I need a step-by-step roadmap to develop a creative project. My goal is to move from a feeling of being 'stuck' and 'haphazard' to a clear, actionable plan. Based on the project description below, create a multi-phase roadmap (e.g., Phase 1: Foundation, Phase 2: Prototyping, etc.). Each phase should contain 2-3 concrete, actionable steps with a brief explanation of "Why" each step is important.

  PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  
  \[Describe your project and your goal. For example, "I want to refine my nearly-complete game, 'Tuck'd-In Terrors,' into a polished, cohesive experience."\]

## **üé¨ Phase 2: Generating Game Components & Mechanics**

### **2.1 Design a New Game Card**

- **Purpose:** To generate a new, balanced card with a clear thematic concept and mechanics.
- **Exemplar Prompt:**  
  Act as a game designer for Tuck'd-In Terrors. Using the provided files for context, design a new Toy card.

  1\. \*\*Card Name:\*\* The Raggedy Prince  
  2\. \*\*Thematic Concept:\*\* A once-noble doll that has been patched up so many times it has forgotten its own story. It protects other toys but falls apart in the process.  
  3\. \*\*Desired Mechanics:\*\* It should have a way to protect your First Memory (‚úß) and should involve a sacrifice (‚úÇÔ∏è) or exile component.  
  4\. \*\*Target Mana Cost:\*\* 3  
  5\. \*\*Complexity:\*\* Moderate

  Please provide the following in a clear format: Card Name, Type & Icons, Cost, Quantity, Card Text, Flavor Text, and a brief Reasoning Note explaining its balance and theme.

### **2.2 Brainstorm a New Keyword**

- **Purpose:** To create and define a new keyword and understand its strategic purpose in the game.
- **Exemplar Prompt:**  
  Act as a game mechanics designer. Based on the existing keywords in Tuck'd-In Terrors (like Haunt, Echo), I want to brainstorm a new keyword.

  1\. \*\*Keyword Name Idea:\*\* "Fray"  
  2\. \*\*Thematic Idea:\*\* Represents a memory or toy that is falling apart. The effect should be a small, recurring negative consequence.

  Please provide:  
  1\. A clear rules definition for "Fray".  
  2\. An example of how it would look on a Toy card and a Ritual card.  
  3\. A short paragraph on what strategic purpose "Fray" would serve.

## **üîÑ Phase 3: Narrative and World-Building**

### **3.1 Generate Thematic Journal Prompts**

- **Purpose:** To create new, tonally consistent narrative content for your game.
- **Exemplar Prompt:**  
  Act as a creative writer in the style of the 'memory journal prompts' file. My goal is to create a new Objective's worth of journal prompts.

  \* \*\*Objective Title:\*\* "The Empty Swing Set"  
  \* \*\*Core Theme:\*\* A memory of playing outside that is tinged with loneliness and the feeling of being watched.

  Please generate 12 new journal prompts, each 1-2 sentences long, that are evocative, slightly melancholic, and fit this theme.

### **3.2 Write Rulebook Narrative in a Specific Voice**

- **Purpose:** To seamlessly integrate new rules explanations into your existing narrative framework.
- **Exemplar Prompt:**  
  Using the persona of "The Rememberer" from the 'rulebook' file, write a new narrative section for the rulebook.

  \* \*\*Topic:\*\* This section should introduce the concept of "Distortion" cards.  
  \* \*\*Tone:\*\* It should be written in the same reflective, slightly unnerved voice. It should explain that as memories get deeper, they also become less reliable.  
  \* \*\*Desired Length:\*\* 2-3 short paragraphs.

## **üìä Phase 4: Playtesting and Balance Analysis**

### **4.1 Request a Balance Analysis**

- **Purpose:** To get targeted, constructive feedback on a specific game component you are concerned about.
- **Exemplar Prompt:**  
  Act as a playtest analyst.

  1\. \*\*Card to Analyze:\*\* "The Whispering Doll"  
  2\. \*\*My Concern:\*\* I am concerned that the die roll result of (6) "Take an extra turn" is too powerful and creates a snowball effect.

  Please provide a balance analysis.  
  1\. Confirm if my concern is valid.  
  2\. Suggest 1-2 specific, alternative effects for the \#6 die roll that are still exciting but more balanced.  
  3\. Provide the reasoning for your suggestions.

### **4.2 The Rule Clarification Loop**

- **Purpose:** A simple but powerful technique to use during solo playtesting to resolve rules ambiguities quickly.
- **Process:**
  1. **Ask a specific, small question:** "How many cards do I draw?"
  2. **Rephrase your understanding:** "So for the first night set up, I'm basically starting with two toys in play and I should have three cards in my hand?" This allows the AI to pinpoint your exact misunderstanding and provide a precise correction.
