### **Handbook 2: The Satirical Brand-Builder's Handbook**

**Introduction: From a Single Joke to a Cohesive Universe**

This handbook is your guide for creating and scaling an edgy, satirical, or humor-based brand. The goal is to move beyond funny one-offs and build a cohesive world with a consistent, "weirdly specific" voice. The prompts here are designed to help you generate everything from merchandise and comics to character lore and social media posts, all while staying true to the core joke. This is about turning a single premise into a fully-realized, absurd brand universe.

#### **Chapter 1: The Core Principles of Satirical Prompting**

1. **Start with Clear Intent, but Leave Room to Improvise**: Give a sharp, direct creative angle (e.g., "Let’s build a parody brand from this horror poster"), but let the AI stretch into unexpected genres and styles. The best results often come from giving the AI guardrails, not a straitjacket.  
2. **Use Strong Style Anchors**: Vague descriptions lead to generic humor. Use vivid, high-context comparisons to lock in the tone. For example, "King of the Hill meets Vice for Boomers" is infinitely more useful than "make it funny."  
3. **Iterate Toward the Weird**: The first idea is rarely the most iconic. Use follow-up prompts like "make it weirder," "now do it in the style of a 1970s army field manual," or "make it more unhinged." Iteration is how you find the brand's unique voice.  
4. **Embody the Character Voice**: To train the AI on your brand's internal logic, prompt it to speak *as* your characters. This builds consistency and helps develop a rich internal world.
