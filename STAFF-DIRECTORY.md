## üéÆ Advanced Usage Patterns

### **Multi-Department Projects**
For complex projects requiring multiple departments:

```
"I need a cross-departmental team for a brand campaign. 
Chief of Staff should coordinate, Creative Strategist should develop the approach, 
Art Director should handle visuals, and Copywriter should create the messaging."
```

### **Specialist Handoffs**
Sequential collaboration patterns:

```
"Art Director, establish the visual hierarchy for this landing page.
Once complete, hand off to Copywriter to write copy that works with your layout."
```

### **Knowledge Synthesis**
Combining expertise across domains:

```
"Historical Storyteller, provide the narrative framework.
Then Borgesian Beat Comic Futurist, adapt this for a science fiction setting."
```
